# expo-screen

You are working in an Expo (SDK ~54) + React Native app using expo-router, TypeScript (strict), and NativeWind.

Task:
- Create or update an expo-router screen in `app/` following the existing routing conventions.

Requirements:
- Do not change route structure unless explicitly requested.
- Keep screen code small; extract reusable UI to `components/`.
- Extract non-UI logic to `hooks/` or `lib/`.
- Use NativeWind classes + existing theme constants (Colors, FontSizes).
- Keep code/comments/identifiers in English.

Output format:
1) Brief plan (2–5 bullets)
2) Files to change
3) Final code for each file (copy-paste ready)
4) Manual test steps for iOS + Android + Web
