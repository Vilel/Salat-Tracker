# expo-ui-a11y

You are improving UI/UX and accessibility for the selected screen/component.

Focus:
- Spacing/typography consistency (use FontSizes / theme colors)
- Touch targets and press feedback
- Better loading/empty/error states
- Accessibility (labels/roles where relevant, readable contrast)
- Responsive layout across device sizes

Rules:
- Use NativeWind and existing theme system.
- Avoid introducing new UI libraries.
- Keep business logic unchanged unless explicitly requested.

Deliver:
1) Issues found
2) Proposed improvements
3) Final code changes (copy-paste ready)
4) Visual QA checklist (light/dark, iOS/Android, small/large screens)
