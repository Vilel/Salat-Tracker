# expo-component

You are creating or refactoring a reusable UI component for this Expo + NativeWind project.

Task:
- Create/refactor a component under `components/` and wire it where needed.

Requirements:
- Reuse existing patterns and theme primitives (Colors, FontSizes).
- Prefer NativeWind classes; use inline styles only when necessary (animation, shadows, platform-specific).
- Keep components focused; move logic to hooks/lib where appropriate.
- Keep code/comments/identifiers in English.

Output format:
1) Brief plan
2) Files to change
3) Final code (copy-paste ready)
4) Manual test checklist (visual + interaction + dark/light)
