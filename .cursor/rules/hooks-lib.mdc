hooks/ and lib/ rules:

- Keep functions small, typed, and testable.
- Avoid UI concerns (no View/Text/StyleSheet) in lib/.
- Prefer pure helpers in lib/ and React hooks in hooks/.
- Handle error cases explicitly (network failures, missing data, parse errors).
- Do not store secrets in code or in storage keys.
