UI & styling rules (app/ and components/):

- Use NativeWind/Tailwind classes where the project already does.
- Use existing theme primitives from constants/theme (Colors, FontSizes, etc.).
- Avoid introducing new styling systems or UI libraries without explicit approval.
- Prefer consistent spacing and typography; keep contrast/accessibility in mind.
- Use inline styles only when needed (platform-specific cases, animated values, shadows).
