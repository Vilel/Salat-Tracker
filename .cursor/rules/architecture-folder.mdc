Follow these folder conventions:

- app/: expo-router routes and screens. Preserve routing structure and conventions.
- components/: reusable UI components.
- hooks/: reusable hooks.
- lib/: pure logic modules (API calls, calculations, storage helpers). No UI here.
- constants/: theme, i18n, static configuration.

Do NOT create new top-level folders without explicit request.
Prefer reusing existing patterns and files over introducing new ones.
