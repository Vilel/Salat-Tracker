This repository is an Expo (SDK ~54) + React Native app using:
- expo-router (file-based routing) with typed routes enabled
- TypeScript (strict) with @/* path alias
- NativeWind (Tailwind) for styling
- AsyncStorage for persistence
- expo-location + reverse geocoding for location
- Internationalization via LanguageProvider + expo-localization
- react-native-svg, Reanimated and Lottie for visuals/animations
- External API: Aladhan Prayer Times

Goal: make incremental, low-risk changes that match existing patterns.
