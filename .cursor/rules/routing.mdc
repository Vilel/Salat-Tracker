expo-router rules (app/ only):

- Keep screens minimal: UI + orchestration only.
- Extract reusable UI into components/.
- Extract non-UI logic into hooks/ or lib/.
- Do not change route paths, layout structure, or navigation patterns unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer typed routes and correct hrefs; do not invent routes that do not exist.
