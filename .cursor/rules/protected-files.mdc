Do NOT modify these files unless I explicitly ask:
- app.json, eas.json
- babel.config.js, metro.config.js, tailwind.config.js
- package.json and lockfiles
- any .env files and secrets

If you believe a change is necessary:
- explain why,
- describe the impact,
- and wait for my approval before editing.
